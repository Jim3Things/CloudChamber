This directory contains the standard configuration file that can be used for 
simple CloudChamber deployments, and as a starting point for customization.

As a side note, the 'cloudchamber.yaml' file is slightly different from the
in-code default values.  These differences are intentional.  They are not 
semantically important, and exist to make unit test validations simpler.
