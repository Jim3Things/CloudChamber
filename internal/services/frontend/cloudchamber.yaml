  # Test specific configuration.
  #
  # Setting UseTestNamespace to 1 will instruct the store to use
  # a pre-defined test namespace which optionally can be deleted
  # prior to running the any tests. Only the test namespace is
  # affected by any cleanining.
  #
  # If UseUniqueInstance is set to 1, the tests will write to a
  # unique namespace to isolate test results from run to run.
  #
  # If PreCleanStore is set to 1, the test will clean the store
  # of existing tests using the same namespace. Effectively this
  # means just the standard namespace as any unique namespaces
  # will not match.
