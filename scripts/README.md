This directory contains the scripts used to start a CloudChamber
simulation.  These are copied into the deployments directory and 
form part of the delivery package.

- start_cloud_chamber.cmd: Start the CloudChamber services
- startetcd.cmd: Start the ETCD storage service

[TODO: startetcd should be incorporated into start_cloud_chamber]
