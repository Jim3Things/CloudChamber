This directory contains scripts used to test Cloud Chamber. All build and
cleaning tasts are performed with the Makefile in the project root directory.

# Test
The procedures are:
- test.cmd: runs unit tests.  Invoke with a test name, or with * to run all
known stable tests.  '-v' can be added as a trailing qualifier to get the
trace output when it runs.
