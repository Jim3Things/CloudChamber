This directory contains end to end and milestone validation tests.

The directories that are named MileStoneX each contain the end to end test

- Milestone1: This milestone shows the creation of a CloudChamber simulation,
logging in on the admin account, listing the simulated inventory (racks, blades, 
and the details on the blades), and then logging out.

- Milestone2: TBD
